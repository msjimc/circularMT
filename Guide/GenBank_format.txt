1 Introduction    
Nucleic acid sequences provide the fundamental starting point for describing     
and understanding the structure, function, and development of genetically     
diverse organisms. The GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ nucleic acid sequence data     
banks have from their inception used tables of sites and features to describe     
the roles and locations of higher order sequence domains and elements within     
the genome of an organism.     
In February, 1986, GenBank and EMBL began a collaborative effort (joined by     
DDBJ in 1987) to devise a common feature table format and common standards for     
annotation practice.     
    
    
2 Overview of the Feature Table format    
The overall goal of the feature table design is to provide an extensive     
vocabulary for describing features in a flexible framework for manipulating     
them. The Feature Table documentation represents the shared rules that allow     
the three databases to exchange data on a daily basis.     
The range of features to be represented is diverse, including regions which:     
* perform a biological function,     
* affect or are the result of the expression of a biological function,     
* interact with other molecules,     
* affect replication of a sequence,     
* affect or are the result of recombination of different sequences,     
* are a recognizable repeated unit,     
* have secondary or tertiary structure,    
* exhibit variation, or have been revised or corrected.    
    
    
    
2.1 Format Design    
     
The format design is based on a tabular approach and consists of the following     
items:     
    
Feature key - a single word or abbreviation indicating functional group      
Location - instructions for finding the feature     
Qualifiers - auxiliary information about a feature     
     
    
    
2.2 Key aspects of this feature table design    
* Feature keys allow specific annotation of important sequence features.    
    
* Related features can be easily specified and retrieved.    
Feature keys are arranged hierarchically, allowing complex and compound     
features to be expressed. Both location operators and the feature keys show     
feature relationships even when the features are not contiguous. The hierarchy     
of feature keys allows broad categories of biological functionality, such as     
rRNAs, to be easily retrieved.    
    
* Generic feature keys provide a means for entering new or undefined features.    
A number of "generic" or miscellaneous feature keys have been added to permit     
annotation of features that cannot be adequately described by existing feature     
keys. These generic feature keys will serve as an intermediate step in the     
identification and addition of new feature keys. The syntax has been designed     
to allow the addition of new feature keys as they are required.     
    
* More complex locations (fuzzy and alternate ends, for example) can be specified.    
Each end point of a feature may be specified as a single point, an alternate     
set of possible end points, a base number beyond which the end point lies, or     
a region which contains the end point.     
    
* Features can be combined and manipulated in many different ways.    
The location field can contain operators or functional descriptors specifying     
what must be done to the sequence to reproduce the feature. For example, a     
series of exons may be "join"ed into a full coding sequence.     
    
* Standardized qualifiers provide precision and parsibility of descriptive details     
A combination of standardized qualifiers and their controlled-vocabulary     
values enable free-text descriptions to be avoided.    
     
* The nature of supporting evidence for a feature can be explicitly indicated.    
Features, such as open reading frames or sequences showing sequence similarity     
to consensus sequences, for which there is no direct experimental evidence can     
be annotated. Therefore, the feature table can incorporate contributions from     
researchers doing computational analysis of the sequence databases. However,     
all features that are supported by experimental data will be clearly marked as     
such.     
    
* The table syntax has been designed to be machine parsible.    
A consistent syntax allows machine extraction and manipulation of sequences     
coding for all features in the table.    
     
    
2.3 Feature Table Terminology    
The format and wording in the feature table use common biological research     
terminology whenever possible. For example, an item in the feature table such as:     
    
Key             Location/Qualifiers    
CDS             23..400    
                /product="alcohol dehydrogenase"     
                /gene="adhI"    
     
might be read as:     
The feature  CDS  is a coding sequence beginning at base 23 and ending at base     
400, has a product called 'alcohol dehydrogenase' and is coded for by a gene     
called "adhI".    
    
A more complex description:    
Key             Location/Qualifiers    
CDS             join(544..589,688..&gt;1032)    
                /product="T-cell receptor beta-chain"    
    
which might be read as:     
This feature, which is a partial coding sequence,  is formed by joining     
elements indicated to form one contiguous sequence encoding a product called T-    
cell receptor beta-chain.     
    
The following sections contain detailed explanations of the feature table     
design showing conventions for each component of the feature table, examples     
of how the format might be implemented, a description of the exact column     
placement of all the data items and examples of complete sequence entries that     
have been annotated using the new format. The last section of this document     
describes known limitations of the current feature table design.     
    
Appendix I gives an example database entry for the DDBJ, GenBank and EMBL      
formats.     
    
Appendices II and III provide reference manuals for the feature table keys and     
qualifiers, respectively.     
    
Appendix IV includes controlled vocabularies such as nucleotide base codes,     
modified base abbreviations, genetic code tables etc.    
    
This document defines the syntax and vocabulary of the feature table. The     
syntax is sufficiently flexible to allow expression of a single biological     
entity in numerous ways. In such cases, the annotation staffs at the databases     
will propose conventions for standard means of denoting the entities.     
This feature table format is shared by GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ. Comments,     
corrections, and suggestions may be submitted to any of the database staffs.     
New format specifications will be added as needed.     
     
    
3 Feature table components and format    
    
3.1 Naming conventions    
Feature table components, including feature keys, qualifiers, accession     
numbers, database name abbreviations, and location operators, are all named     
following the same conventions. Component names may be no more than 20     
characters long  (Feature keys 15, Feature qualifiers 20) and must     
contain at least one letter. The following characters are permitted to     
occur in feature table component names:     
    
* Uppercase letters (A-Z)     
* Lowercase letters (a-z) Numbers (0-9)     
* Underscore (_)     
* Hyphen (-)     
* Single quotation mark or apostrophe (')     
* Asterisk (*)     
    
    
    
3.2 Feature keys    
    
3.2.1 Purpose    
Feature keys indicate     
(1) the biological nature of the annotated feature or     
(2) information about changes to or other versions of the sequence.     
The feature key permits a user to quickly find or retrieve similar features or     
features with related functions.     
    
    
3.2.2 Format and conventions    
There is a defined list of allowable feature keys, which is shown in Appendix     
II. Each feature must contain a feature key.     
     
    
3.2.3 Key groups and hierarchy    
The feature keys fall into families which are in some sense similar in     
function and which are annotated in a similar manner. A functional family may     
have a "generic" or miscellaneous key, which can be recognized by the 'misc.'     
prefix, that can used for instances not covered by the other defined keys of     
that group.     
    
The feature key groups are listed below with a short definition and an     
annotation example:     
    
1. Difference and change features    
    
Indicate ways in which a sequence should be changed to produce a different     
version:     
misc_difference location    
              /replace="change_location"    
    
2. Transcript features    
    
Indicate products made by a region:     
misc_RNA        location    
    
    
3. Binding features    
    
Indicate that a sequence or nucleotide is covalently, non-covalently, or     
otherwise bound to something else:     
misc_binding    location    
                /bound_moiety="bound molecule"     
    
4. Repeat features    
    
Indicate repetitive sequence elements:     
repeat_region   location    
    
    
5. Recombination features    
    
Indicate regions that have been either inserted or deleted by recombination:     
misc_recomb     location    
    
    
6. Structure features    
    
Indicate sequence for which there is secondary or tertiary structural     
information:     
misc_structure  location    
    
    
3.2.4 Feature key examples    
Key                     Description         
    
CDS                     Protein-coding sequence     
rep_origin              Origin of replication    
protein_bind            Protein binding site on DNA    
tRNA                    mature transfer RNA    
    
See Appendix II for descriptions of all feature keys.     
    
    
3.3 Qualifiers    
    
3.3.1 Purpose    
Qualifiers provide a general mechanism for supplying information about     
features in addition to that conveyed by the key and location.     
    
    
3.3.2 Format and conventions    
Qualifiers take the form of a slash (/) followed by the qualifier name and, if     
applicable, an equal sign (=) and a value. Each qualifier should have a single     
value; if multiple values are necessary, these should be represented by     
iterating the same qualifier, eg:     
Key             Location/Qualifiers    
    
source          1..1000    
                /culture_collection="ATCC:11775"    
                /culture_collection="CECT:515"    
    
If the location descriptor does not need a continuation line, the first     
qualifier begins a new line in the feature location column. If the location     
descriptor requires a continuation line, the first qualifier may follow     
immediately after the location. Any necessary continuation lines begin in the     
same column. See Section 4 for a complete description of data item positions.     
     
    
    
3.3.3 Qualifier values    
Since qualifiers convey many different types of information, there are several value formats:     
1. Free text     
2. Controlled vocabulary or enumerated values     
3. Citation or reference numbers     
4. Sequences    
3.3.3.1 Free text    
Most qualifier values will be a descriptive text phrase which must be enclosed     
in double quotation marks. When the text occupies more than one line, a single     
set of quotation marks is required at the beginning and at the end of the     
text. The text itself may be composed of any printable characters (ASCII     
values 32-126 decimal). If double quotation marks are used within a free text     
string, each set (") must be 'escaped' by placing a second double quotation     
mark immediately before it (""). For example:     
              /note="This is an example of ""escaped"" quotation marks"    
3.3.3.2 Controlled vocabulary or enumerated values    
Some qualifiers require values from a controlled vocabulary and are entered     
without quotation marks. For example, the '/direction' qualifier has only     
three values: 'left', 'right' or 'both'. Qualifier value controlled     
vocabularies, like feature table component names, must be treated as     
completely case insensitive: they may be entered and displayed in any     
combination of upper and lower case ('/direction=Left' '/direction=left' and '/    
direction=LEFT' are all legal and all convey the same meaning). The database     
staffs reserve the right to regularize the case of qualifier values. Qualifier     
value controlled vocabularies will be maintained by the cooperating database     
staffs. Examples of controlled vocabularies can be found in Appendices IV and     
V. The database staff should be contacted for the current lists.    
3.3.3.3 Citation or reference numbers    
The citation or published reference number (as enumerated in the entry     
'REFERENCE' or 'RN' data item) should be enclosed in square brackets     
(e.g., [3]) to distinguish it from other numbers.    
3.3.3.4 Sequences    
Literal sequence of nucleotide bases e.g., join(12..45,"atgcatt",988..1050) in     
location descriptors has become illegal starting from implementation of     
version 2.1 of the Feature Table Definition Document (December 15, 1998)

                /product="ubiquitin conjugating enzyme"    
                /function="cell division control"    
    
    
    
3.4 Location    
    
3.4.1 Purpose    
The location indicates the region of the presented sequence which corresponds     
to a feature.     
    
    
3.4.2 Format and conventions    
The location contains at least one sequence location descriptor and may     
contain one or more operators with one or more sequence location descriptors.     
Base numbers refer to the numbering in the entry. This numbering designates     
the first base (5' end) of the presented sequence as base 1.     
Base locations beyond the range of the presented sequence may not be used in     
location descriptors, the only exception being location in a remote entry (see     
3.4.2.1, e).      
    
Location operators and descriptors are discussed in more detail below.    
3.4.2.1 Location descriptors    
The location descriptor can be one of the following:     
(a) a single base number    
(b) a site between two indicated adjoining bases    
(c) a single base chosen from within a specified range of bases (not allowed for new    
    entries)    
(d) the base numbers delimiting a sequence span    
(e) a remote entry identifier followed by a local location descriptor    
    (i.e., a-d)    
    
A site between two adjoining nucleotides, such as endonucleolytic cleavage     
site, is indicated by listing the two points separated by a carat (^). The     
permitted formats for this descriptor are n^n+1 (for example 55^56), or, for     
circular molecules, n^1, where "n" is the full length of the molecule, ie     
1000^1 for circular molecule with length 1000.    
    
A single base chosen from a range of bases is indicated by the first base     
number and the last base number of the range separated by a single period     
(e.g., '12.21' indicates a single base taken from between the indicated     
points). From October 2006 the usage of this descriptor is restricted :     
it is illegal to use "a single base from a range" (c) either on its own or     
in combination with the "sequence span" (d) descriptor for newly created entries.     
The existing entries where such descriptors exist are going to be retrofitted.     
    
Sequence spans are indicated by the starting base number and the ending base     
number separated by two periods (e.g., '34..456'). The '&lt;' and '&gt;' symbols may     
be used with the starting and ending base numbers to indicate that an end     
point is beyond the specified base number. The starting and ending base     
positions can be represented as distinct base numbers ('34..456') or a site     
between two indicated adjoining bases.     
    
A location in a remote entry (not the entry to which the feature table     
belongs) can be specified by giving  the accession-number and sequence version     
of the remote entry, followed by a colon ":", followed by a location     
descriptor which applies to that entry's sequence (i.e. J12345.1:1..15, see     
also examples below)    
3.4.2.2 Operators    
The location operator is a prefix that specifies what must be done to the     
indicated sequence to find or construct the location corresponding to the     
feature. A list of operators is given below with their definitions and most     
common format.     
    
complement(location)     
Find the complement of the presented sequence in the span specified by "    
location" (i.e., read the complement of the presented strand in its 5'-to-3'     
direction)     
    
join(location,location, ... location)     
The indicated elements should be joined (placed end-to-end) to form one     
contiguous sequence     
    
order(location,location, ... location)     
The elements can be found in the     
specified order (5' to 3' direction), but nothing is implied about the     
reasonableness about joining them     
    
Note : location operator "complement" can be used in combination with either "    
join" or "order" within the same location; combinations of "join" and "order"     
within the same location (nested operators) are illegal.    
    
    
    
    
3.4.3 Location examples    
The following is a list of common location descriptors with their meanings:     
    
Location                  Description       
    
467                       Points to a single base in the presented sequence     
    
340..565                  Points to a continuous range of bases bounded by and    
                          including the starting and ending bases    
    
&lt;345..500                 Indicates that the exact lower boundary point of a feature    
                          is unknown.  The location begins at some  base previous to    
                          the first base specified (which need not be contained in     
                          the presented sequence) and continues to and includes the     
                          ending base     
    
&lt;1..888                   The feature starts before the first sequenced base and     
                          continues to and includes base 888    
    
1..&gt;888                   The feature starts at the first sequenced base and     
                          continues beyond base 888    
    
102.110                   Indicates that the exact location is unknown but that it is     
                          one of the bases between bases 102 and 110, inclusive    
    
123^124                   Points to a site between bases 123 and 124    
    
join(12..78,134..202)     Regions 12 to 78 and 134 to 202 should be joined to form     
                          one contiguous sequence    
    
    
complement(34..126)       Start at the base complementary to 126 and finish at the     
                          base complementary to base 34 (the feature is on the strand     
                          complementary to the presented strand)    
    
    
complement(join(2691..4571,4918..5163))

4.2 Definition of line types    
The feature table consists of a header line, which contains the column titles     
for the table, and the individual feature entries. Each feature entry is     
composed of a feature descriptor line and qualifier and continuation lines,     
if needed. The feature descriptor line contains the feature's name, key, and     
location. If the location cannot be contained on the first line of the feature     
descriptor, it is continued on a continuation line immediately following the     
descriptor line. If the feature requires further attributes, feature qualifier     
lines immediately follow the corresponding feature descriptor line (or its     
continuation). Qualifier information that cannot be contained on one line     
continues on the following continuation lines as necessary.    
     
Thus, there are 4 types of feature table lines:     
      Line type            Content                 #/entry     #/feature    
      ---------            -------                 -------     ---------    
    
      Header               Column titles           1*          N/A    
      Feature descriptor   Key and location        1 to many*  1    
      Feature qualifiers   Qualifiers and values   N/A         0 to many    
      Continuation lines   Feature descriptor or   0 to many   0 to many    
                           qualifier continuation    
    
    
    
4.3 Data item positions    
The position of the data items within the feature descriptor line is as follows:     
     column position    data item    
     ---------------    ---------    
    
     1-5                blank     
     6-20               feature key    
     21                 blank    
     22-80              location    
    
Data on the qualifier and continuation lines begins in column position 22 (the     
first 21 columns contain blanks). The EMBL format for all lines differs from     
the GenBank / DDBJ formats  that it includes a line type abbreviation in     
columns 1 and 2.     
    
    
4.4 Use of blanks    
Blanks (spaces) may, in general, be used within the feature location and     
qualifier values to make the construction more readable. The following rules     
should be observed:     
* Names of feature table components may not contain blanks (see Section 3.1)     
* Operator names may not be separated from the following open parenthesis (the     
  beginning of the operand list) by blanks.     
* Qualifiers may not be separated from the preceding slash or the following     
  equals sign (if one) by blanks

6 Limitations of this feature table design    
During the development of the feature table design numerous choices between     
simplicity and representational power had to be made. In order to create a     
design which was capable of representing the most common features of     
biological significance, a certain degree of complexity in the syntax was     
guaranteed. However, to limit that level of complexity, certain limitations of     
the design syntax have been accepted.

7.2 Appendix II: Feature keys reference    
The following has been organized according to the following format:     
Feature Key             the feature key name    
Definition              the definition of the key    
Mandatory qualifiers    qualifiers required with the key; if there are no    
                        mandatory qualifiers, this field is omitted.    
Optional qualifiers     optional qualifiers associated with the key    
Organism scope          valid organisms for the key; if the scope is any    
                        organism, this field is omitted.    
Molecule scope          valid molecule types; if the scope is any molecule    
                        type, this field is omitted.    
References              citations of published reports, usually supporting the    
                        feature consensus sequence    
Comment                 comments and clarifications    
Abbreviations:     
accnum                  an entry primary accession number    
&lt;amino_acid&gt;            abbreviation for amino acid    
&lt;base_range&gt;            location descriptor for a simple range of bases    
&lt;bool&gt;                  Boolean truth value.  Valid values are yes and no    
&lt;integer&gt;               unsigned integer value    
&lt;location&gt;              general feature location descriptor    
&lt;modified_base&gt;         abbreviation for modified nucleotide base    
[number]                integer representing number of citation in entry's    
                        reference list    
&lt;repeat_type&gt;           value indicating the organization of a repeated    
                        sequence.      
text                  any text or character string. Since the string is    
                        delimited by double quotes, double quotes may only    
                        appear as part of the string if they appear in pairs.    
                        For example, the sentence:    
    
                        The "label" qualifier is no longer legal.    
    
                        would be formatted thus:    
    
                        "The ""label"" qualifier is no longer legal."    
               
    
Feature Key           assembly_gap    
    
    
Definition            gap between two components of a genome or transcriptome assembly;    
    
Mandatory qualifiers  /estimated_length=unknown or &lt;integer&gt;    
        /gap_type="TYPE"  
                      /linkage_evidence="TYPE" (Note: Mandatory only if the     
                      /gap_type is "within scaffold", "repeat within scaffold" or "contamination".    
                      If there are multiple types of linkage_evidence    
                      they will appear as multiple /linkage_evidence="TYPE"    
                      qualifiers. For all other types of assembly_gap    
                      features, use of the /linkage_evidence qualifier is     
                      invalid.)    
                      Mandatory qualifiers under assembly_gap feature for transcriptome    
                      shotgun assemblies (TSA):    
                      /estimated_length=&lt;integer&gt;    
                      /gap_type="within scaffold" and /linkage_evidence="TYPE" where TYPE    
                      can not be "unspecified";                         
    
Comment               the location span of the assembly_gap feature for an unknown gap has     
                      to be specified by the submitter; the specified gap length has to be     
                      reasonable (less or = 1000) and will be indicated as "n"'s in sequence.    
                      However, the value for the estimated_length of assembly_gap features     
                      within a single (non-CON) transcriptome record must be an integer     
                      and can not be "unknown";    
    
    
    
Feature Key           C_region    
    
    
Definition            constant region of immunoglobulin light and heavy     
                      chains, and T-cell receptor alpha, beta, and gamma     
                      chains; includes one or more exons depending on the     
                      particular chain    
    
Optional qualifiers   /allele="text"    
                      /db_xref="&lt;database&gt;:&lt;identifier&gt;"    
                      /experiment="[CATEGORY:]text"

Definition            a small region of sequenced bases, generally 10 or fewer in its length, which     
                      could not be confidently identified. Such a region might contain called bases     
                      (A, T, G, or C), or a mixture of called-bases and uncalled-bases ('N').    
                      The unsure feature should not be used when annotating gaps in genome assemblies.    
                      Please refer to assembly_gap feature for gaps within the sequence of an assembled    
                      genome. For annotation of gaps in other sequences than assembled genomes use the     
                      gap feature.

7.3 Appendix III: Summary of qualifiers for feature keys    
    
7.3.1 Qualifier List    
The following is a list of available qualifiers for feature keys and their usage.     
The information is arranged as follows:    
    
    
Qualifier       name of qualifier; qualifier requires a value if followed by an equal     
                sign    
Definition      definition of the qualifier    
Value format    format of value, if required    
Example         example of qualifier with value    
Comment         comments, questions and clarifications    
    
    
Qualifier       /allele=    
Definition      name of the allele for the given gene     
Value format    "text"    
Example         /allele="adh1-1"    
Comment         all gene-related features (exon, CDS etc) for a given     
                gene should share the same /allele qualifier value;     
                the /allele qualifier value must, by definition, be     
                different from the /gene qualifier value; when used with     
                the variation feature key, the allele qualifier value     
                should be that of the variant.    
    
    
Qualifier       /altitude=    
Definition      geographical altitude of the location from which the sample    
                was collected

                provided in metres    
    
    
    
Qualifier       /anticodon=    
Definition      location of the anticodon of tRNA and the amino acid for which    
                it codes    
Value format    (pos:&lt;location&gt;,aa:&lt;amino_acid&gt;,seq:&lt;text&gt;) where location    
                is the position of the anticodon and amino_acid is the abbreviation for the    
                amino acid encoded and seq is the sequence of the anticodon    
Example         /anticodon=(pos:34..36,aa:Phe,seq:aaa)    
                /anticodon=(pos:join(5,495..496),aa:Leu,seq:taa)    
                /anticodon=(pos:complement(4156..4158),aa:Gln,seq:ttg)    
    
    
Qualifier       /artificial_location    
Definition      indicates that location of the CDS or mRNA is modified to adjust    
                for the presence of a frameshift or internal stop codon and not    
                because of biological processing between the regions.    
Value format    "heterogeneous population sequenced", "low-quality sequence region"    
Example         /artificial_location="heterogeneous population sequenced"    
                /artificial_location="low-quality sequence region"

Qualifier       /bio_material=    
Definition      identifier for the biological material from which the nucleic    
                acid sequenced was obtained, with optional institution code and    
                collection code for the place where it is currently stored.    
Value format    "[&lt;institution-code&gt;:[&lt;collection-code&gt;:]]&lt;material_id&gt;"    
Example         /bio_material="CGC:CB3912"      &lt;- Caenorhabditis stock centre    
Comment         the bio_material qualifier should be used to annotate the    
                identifiers of material in biological collections that are not    
                appropriate to annotate as either /specimen_voucher or    
                /culture_collection; these include zoos and aquaria, stock

Qualifier       /circular_RNA    
Definition      indicates that exons are out-of-order or overlapping     
                because this spliced RNA product is a circular RNA     
                (circRNA) created by backsplicing, for example when

                Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec    
    
                'YYYY' is a four-digit value representing the year. 'MM' is a two-digit value representing    
                the month. 'DD' is a two-digit value representing the day of the month.    
    
                'hh' is a two-digit value representing the hour of the day (00 to 23)    
                'mm' is a two-digit value representing the minute of the hour (00 to 59)    
                'ss' is a two-digit value representing the second of the hour (00 to 59)    
    
                Within a date range, value formats that make use of 'Mmm' (month abbreviations) cannot be    
                combined with value formats that make use of 'MM' (two-digit month number)    
    
                Collection dates that are specified to at least the month, day, and year (DD-Mmm-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD)    
                are strongly encouraged. If the day and/or month of the collection date are not known,

                Within a collection date range, the first date (possibly including time) must be    
                prior to the second date (possibly including time).    
    
                Within a collection date range for which the day, month, and year are identical, the first time value    
                must be prior to the second time value.

                be used on the following features: misc_difference, unsure, old_sequence     
    and variation.
                The feature "old_sequence" must have either a    
                /citation or a /compare qualifier. Multiple /compare    
                qualifiers with different contents are allowed within a     
                single feature.     
                This qualifier is not intended for large-scale annotation

Comment         Intended to provide a reference to the site where the source    
                organism was isolated or sampled. Regions and localities should    
                be indicated where possible. Note that the physical geography of    
                the isolation or sampling site should be represented in    
                /isolation_source. From June 2024, the /country    
                qualifier will be transitioned to /geo_loc_name. /country may    
                still be encountered on records prior to this date.      
    
    
Qualifier       /cultivar=    
Definition      cultivar (cultivated variety) of plant from which sequence was

                /cultivar="IR36"    
Comment         'cultivar' is applied solely to products of artificial     
                selection;  use the variety qualifier for natural, named     
                plant and fungal varieties;      
    
    
Qualifier       /culture_collection=    
Definition      institution code and identifier for the culture from which the    
                nucleic acid sequenced was obtained, with optional collection    
                code.    
Value format    "&lt;institution-code&gt;:[&lt;collection-code&gt;:]&lt;culture_id&gt;"    
Example         /culture_collection="ATCC:26370"    
Comment         the /culture_collection qualifier should be used to annotate    
                live microbial and viral cultures, and cell lines that have been    
                deposited in curated culture collections; microbial cultures in    
                personal or laboratory collections should be annotated in strain    
                qualifiers;    
                annotation with a culture_collection qualifier implies that the    
                sequence was obtained from a sample retrieved (by the submitter    
                or a collaborator) from the indicated culture collection, or    
                that the sequence was obtained from a sample that was deposited    
                (by the submitter or a collaborator) in the indicated culture    
                collection; annotation with more than one culture_collection    
                qualifier indicates that the sequence was obtained from a sample    
                that was deposited (by the submitter or a collaborator) in more    
                than one culture collection.    
                culture_id and institution_code are mandatory, collection_code    
                is optional; institution code and collection code are taken    
                from a controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC.

Qualifier       /dev_stage=    
Definition      if the sequence was obtained from an organism in a specific     
                developmental stage, it is specified with this qualifier    
Value format    "text"    
Example         /dev_stage="fourth instar larva"    
    
    
Qualifier       /direction=    
Definition      direction of DNA replication    
Value format    left, right, or both where left indicates toward the 5' end of    
                the entry sequence (as presented) and right indicates toward    
                the 3' end    
Example         /direction=LEFT    
    
    
Qualifier       /EC_number=    
Definition      Enzyme Commission number for enzyme product of sequence    
Value format    "text"    
Example         /EC_number="1.1.2.4"    
                /EC_number="1.1.2.-"    
                /EC_number="1.1.2.n"    
                /EC_number="1.1.2.n1"                    
Comment         valid values for EC numbers are defined in the list prepared by the     
                Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and    
                Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) (published in Enzyme Nomenclature 1992,    
                Academic Press, San Diego, or a more recent revision thereof).     
                The format represents a string of four numbers separated by full    
                stops; up to three numbers starting from the end of the string can     
                be replaced by dash "." to indicate uncertain assignment.     
                Symbols including an "n", e.g. "n", "n1" and so on, can be     
                used in the last position instead of a number where the EC number is    
                awaiting assignment. Please note that such incomplete EC numbers     
                are not approved by NC-IUBMB.    
    
    
Qualifier       /ecotype=    
Definition      a population within a given species displaying genetically     
                based, phenotypic traits that reflect adaptation to a local habitat.    
Value Format    "text"    
Example         /ecotype="Columbia"    
Comment         an example of such a population is one that has adapted hairier    
                than normal leaves as a response to an especially sunny habitat.    
                'Ecotype' is often applied to standard genetic stocks of    
                Arabidopsis thaliana, but it can be applied to any sessile     
                organism.    
    
    
Qualifier       /environmental_sample    
Definition      identifies sequences derived by direct molecular    
                isolation from a bulk environmental DNA sample    
                (by PCR with or without subsequent cloning of the    
                product, DGGE, or other anonymous methods) with no    
                reliable identification of the source organism.    
                Environmental samples include clinical samples,    
                gut contents, and other sequences from anonymous    
                organisms that may be associated with a particular    
                host. They do not include endosymbionts that can be    
                reliably recovered from a particular host, organisms    
                from a readily identifiable but uncultured field sample    
                (e.g., many cyanobacteria), or phytoplasmas that can be     
                reliably recovered from diseased plants (even though     
                these cannot be grown in axenic culture).    
Value format    none    
Example         /environmental_sample    
Comment         used only with the source feature key; source feature     
                keys containing the /environmental_sample qualifier     
                should also contain the /isolation_source qualifier.    
                entries including /environmental_sample must not include     
                the /strain qualifier    
    
    
Qualifier       /estimated_length=    
Definition      estimated length of the gap in the sequence    
Value format    unknown or &lt;integer&gt;    
Example         /estimated_length=unknown    
                /estimated_length=342    
    
    
Qualifier       /exception=    
Definition      indicates that the coding region cannot be translated using    
                standard biological rules    
Value format    "RNA editing", "reasons given in citation",    
                "rearrangement required for product", "annotated by transcript    
                or proteomic data"    
Example         /exception="RNA editing"    
                /exception="reasons given in citation"    
                /exception="rearrangement required for product"    
                /exception="annotated by transcript or proteomic data"    
Comment         only to be used to describe biological mechanisms such     
                as RNA editing;  where the exception cannot easily be described     
                a published citation must be referred to; protein translation of    
                /exception CDS will be different from the according conceptual     
                translation;     
                - An /inference qualifier should accompany any use of    
                /exception="annotated by transcript or proteomic data", to    
                provide support for the existence of the transcript/protein.    
                - must not be used where transl_except would be adequate,    
                  e.g. in case of stop codon completion use:    
                /transl_except=(pos:6883,aa:TERM)    
                /note="TAA stop codon is completed by addition of 3' A residues to

Qualifier       /mating_type=    
Definition      mating type of the organism from which the sequence was    
                obtained; mating type is used for prokaryotes, and for    
                eukaryotes that undergo meiosis without sexually dimorphic    
                gametes    
Value format    "text"

Definition      sequences from a Metagenome Assembled Genome (MAG), i.e a single-taxon assembly     
                drawn from a binned metagenome, are specified with this qualifier to indicate    
                that the assembly is derived from a metagenomic source, rather than from an isolated organism.    
                Where this qualifier is present it must contain the word "metagenome" and must exist in the     
                NCBI taxonomy database: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/    
Value format    "text"    
Examples        /metagenome_source="human gut metagenome"    
                /metagenome_source="soil metagenome"    
Comment         the qualifier /metagenome_source is mandatory when a single-taxon sequence is derived from a metagenome;    
                sequences with a /metagenome_source require also an /environmental_sample qualifier.

Example         /mobile_element_type="transposon:Tnp9"    
Comment         /mobile_element_type is legal on mobile_element feature key only.      
                Mobile element should be used to represent both elements which     
                are currently mobile, and those which were mobile in the past.      
                Value "other" requires a mobile_element_name.

                primary entries and the hypothetical molecule in Third Party    
                Annotation entries; the value "genomic DNA" does not imply that    
                the molecule is nuclear (e.g. organelle and plasmid DNA should    
                be described using "genomic DNA"); ribosomal RNA genes should be    
                described using "genomic DNA"; "rRNA" should only be used if the    
                ribosomal RNA molecule itself has been sequenced; /mol_type is    
                mandatory on every source feature key; all /mol_type values    
                within one entry/record must be the same; values "other RNA" and    
                "other DNA" should be applied to synthetic molecules, values    
                "unassigned DNA", "unassigned RNA" should be applied where in    
                vivo molecule is unknown

                where a /locus_tag qualifier is present.      
                Identical /old_locus_tag values may be used within an entry/record,     
                but only if the identical /old_locus_tag values are associated     
                with the same gene; in all other circumstances the /old_locus_tag     
                value must be unique within that entry/record.

Value format    "text"    
Example         /phenotype="erythromycin resistance"    
    
    
    
Qualifier       /plasmid=    
Definition      name of naturally occurring plasmid from which the sequence was

                mRNA feature)    
    
    
Qualifier       /protein_id=    
Definition      protein identifier, issued by International collaborators.    
                this qualifier consists of a stable ID portion (accessioned data    
                before the end of 2018 uses a 3+5 format; from the end of 2018     
                new accessions may be extended to a 3+7 accession format with 3 position    
                letters and 7 numbers) plus a version number after the decimal point.    
Value format    &lt;identifier&gt;

                /protein_id="AAA1234567.1"    
Comment         when the protein sequence encoded by the CDS changes, only     
                the version number of the /protein_id value is incremented;     
                the stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and as a    
                result will permanently be associated with a given protein;    
                this qualifier is valid only on CDS features which translate    
                into a valid protein.     
    
    
Qualifier       /proviral    
Definition      this qualifier is used to flag sequence obtained from a virus or    
                phage that is integrated into the genome of another organism

Definition      indicates that this feature is a non-functional version of the    
                element named by the feature key    
Value format    none    
Example         /pseudo    
Comment         The qualifier /pseudo should be used to describe non-functional     
                genes that are not formally described as pseudogenes, e.g. CDS     
                has no translation due to other reasons than pseudogenisation events.    
                Other reasons may include sequencing or assembly errors.    
                In order to annotate pseudogenes the qualifier /pseudogene= must be    
                used indicating the TYPE which can be taken from the INSDC controlled vocabulary     
                for pseudogenes.    
    
    
    
Qualifier       /pseudogene=    
Definition      indicates that this feature is a pseudogene of the element named    
                by the feature key    
Value format    "TYPE"    
                where TYPE is one of the following:    
                processed, unprocessed, unitary, allelic, unknown    
    
Example         /pseudogene="processed"    
                /pseudogene="unprocessed"    
                /pseudogene="unitary"    
                /pseudogene="allelic"    
                /pseudogene="unknown"    
    
Comment         TYPE is a term taken from the INSDC controlled vocabulary for pseudogenes    
                (https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/pseudogene-qualifier-vocabulary/):    
    
                processed: the pseudogene has arisen by reverse transcription of a     
                mRNA into cDNA, followed by reintegration into the genome. Therefore,    
                it has lost any intron/exon structure, and it might have a pseudo-polyA-tail.    
    
                unprocessed: the pseudogene has arisen from a copy of the parent gene by duplication    
                followed by accumulation of random mutations. The changes, compared to their    
                functional homolog, include insertions, deletions, premature stop codons, frameshifts    
                and a higher proportion of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions.    
    
                unitary: the pseudogene has no parent. It is the original gene, which is    
                functional is some species but disrupted in some way (indels, mutation,     
                recombination) in another species or strain.    
    
                allelic: a (unitary) pseudogene that is stable in the population but    
                importantly it has a functional alternative allele also in the population. i.e.,

                response; these are the T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin    
                loci in the jawed vertebrates, and the unrelated variable     
                lymphocyte receptor (VLR) locus in the jawless fish (lampreys

Comment         the /specimen_voucher qualifier is intended to annotate a    
                reference to the physical specimen that remains after the    
                sequence has been obtained;    
                if the specimen was destroyed in the process of sequencing,    
                electronic images (e-vouchers) are an adequate substitute for a    
                physical voucher specimen; ideally the specimens will be    
                deposited in a curated museum, herbarium, or frozen tissue    
                collection, but often they will remain in a personal or    
                laboratory collection for some time before they are deposited in    
                a curated collection;    
                there are three forms of specimen_voucher qualifiers; if the    
                text of the qualifier includes one or more colons it is a    
                'structured voucher'; structured vouchers include    
                institution-codes (and optional collection-codes) taken from a    
                controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC that denotes the    
                museum or herbarium collection where the specimen resides;

Comment         if the amino acid is not on the restricted vocabulary list use    
                e.g., '/transl_except=(pos:213..215,aa:OTHER)' with    
                '/note="name of unusual amino acid"';    
                for modified amino-acid selenocysteine use three letter code    
                'Sec'  (one letter code 'U' in amino-acid sequence)    
                /transl_except=(pos:1002..1004,aa:Sec);    
                for partial termination codons where TAA stop codon is    
                completed by the addition of 3' A residues to the mRNA    
                either a single base_position or a base_range is used, e.g.    
                if partial stop codon is a single base:    
                /transl_except=(pos:1017,aa:TERM)    
                if partial stop codon consists of two bases:    
                /transl_except=(pos:2000..2001,aa:TERM) with    
                '/note='stop codon completed by the addition of 3' A residues     
                to the mRNA'.    
    
    
Qualifier       /transl_table=    
Definition      definition of genetic code table used if other than universal    
                genetic code table. Tables used are described at the specified URLs in appendix IV.

                intermolecular reaction to form mature RNA     
Value format    none     
Example         /trans_splicing     
Comment         should be used on features such as CDS, mRNA and other features    
                that are produced as a result of a trans-splicing event. This    
                qualifier should be used only when the splice event is indicated in    
                the "join" operator, eg join(complement(69611..69724),139856..140087)    
    
    
Qualifier       /type_material=    
Definition      indicates that the organism from which this sequence was obtained is    
                a nomenclatural type of the species (or subspecies) corresponding with

                /type_material="holotype of Cercopitheus lomamiensis"    
                /type_material="paratype of Cercopitheus lomamiensis"    
Comment         &lt;type-of-type&gt; is taken from the INSDC controlled vocabularly for /type_material    
                at: https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/controlled-vocabulary-typematerial-qualifer/    
                &lt;organism name&gt; should be listed as the scientific name     
                (or as a synonym) at the species (or subspecies) node in the taxonomy database.    
                INSDC will automatically populate this qualifier from the NCBI taxonomy database to    
                flag sequences of form type in the INSDC databases (ENA/GenBank/DDBJ).    
    
    
Qualifier       /variety=
