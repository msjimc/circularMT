# Download

It is possible to download the whole repository by clicking on the green '<> Code' on the main repository page. This will download the whole repository. If you prefer to just download the program follow steps below:

Download program only

This folder contains the precompiled program, dll and config files as both individual files and a zip file. Due to heightened security by some organisation's IT departments it may not be possible to run a program extracted from a zip file. Consequently, you may have to try downloading the program both ways until one way works.

# Running circularMT

To run circularMT double click on the file in File Explorer and it should start. If it doesn't, first make sure that all three files are in the same folder (circularMT.exe, circularMT.dll and circularMT.runtimeconfig.json). If you get an error message such as the one in Figure 6, go to the [.Net download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) and select the appropriate ".NET Desktop Runtime". There are a number of options make sure you chose the Desktop version.
