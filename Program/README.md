# Download

It is possible to download the whole repository by clicking on the green '<> Code' on the main repository page. This will download the whole repository. If you prefer to just download the program follow steps below:

Download program only

This folder contains the precompiled program, dll and config files as both individual files and a zip file. Due to heightened security by some organisation's IT departments it may not be possible to run a program extracted from a zip file. Consequently, you may have to try downloading the program both ways until one way works.

#### Important note  

Once downloaded it is important that the AgileStructure.exe, AgileStructure.dll and AgileStructure.runtimeconfig.json are located in the same folder.
