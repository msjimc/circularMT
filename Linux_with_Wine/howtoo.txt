Step 1: Installing Dependencies:

Before installing Wine, we need to ensure that all the necessary dependencies are in place. Open a terminal and execute the following command:

sudo yum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'

Step 2: Downloading Wine Source Code and Development Libraries:

To begin, we need to download the Wine source code and additional development libraries. Run the following command:
sudo yum install gcc libX11-devel freetype-devel zlib-devel libxcb-devel libxslt-devel libgcrypt-devel libxml2-devel gnutls-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libtiff-devel dbus-devel fontconfig-devel

Step 3: Extracting and Preparing Wine Source Code:

Navigate to the temporary directory and extract the Wine source code using the following commands:
cd /tmp
wget http://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/7.0/wine-7.0.tar.xz
tar -xvf wine-7.0.tar.xz -C /tmp/
cd wine-7.0/

Step 4: Configuring, Building, and Installing Wine:

Now itâ€™s time to configure, build, and install Wine. Run the following commands:

./configure --enable-win64
make
sudo make install

let winecfg install mono at dialogue prompt
